        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've lived my whole life in the same forest. I overheard a group of humans walking by and they mentioned something about the state of Oregon. It rains more days then not, but I like that. Rain and fog make it easier for me to blend in. I pretty much love everything except for birds. </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
      	<p>I am a professional bird-feed eater. Sunflower seeds are my favorite.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I need an adventure. So far I've only lived in two trees. It's a comfy place, but I feel like I'm settling. I'm going to start traveling. I've been doing research and have a list of 4 trees I plan to live in. All I need is to save up enough nuts before I can go.</p>
        <p>The following is my list of must go to trees:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Maple</li>
          <li>Redwoods</li>
          <li>White Oak</li>
          <li>Hawthorn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My plan is to live in each tree for a year. During that year I'll be able to gather enough food to travel to the next place.</p>
